# Plan to build the API

- prepare the dataset


Option 1
- split the dataset by country
  - whole country's data is in one single file
  - api takes input of the country name, search query along with search field (like name, city, etc)
  - api returns the data in json format
  
  - search fields
    - pin code
    - line1
    - line2
